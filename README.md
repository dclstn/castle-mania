> Castle Mania was a global currency game that allowed users to Buy, Sell, Raid, and Gamble their way to the top of the leaderboard while personalizing profiles, forming groups, and exploring various items and features. Despite its popularity, the project has been discontinued due to stagnant development and reduced feasibility of continued maintenance. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to and enjoyed Castle Maniaâ€”it thrived because of your support.
